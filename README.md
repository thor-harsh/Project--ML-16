**In this project we will build the Model Apriori Algorithm for Market Basket analysis based on different items in the dataset**.<br></br>  

Apriori algorithm refers to the algorithm which is used to calculate the association rules between objects.
It means how two or more objects are related to one another. In other words, we can say that the apriori algorithm is an association rule leaning that analyzes that people who bought product A also bought product B.<br></br>
The primary objective of the apriori algorithm is to create the association rule between different objects. 
The association rule describes how two or more objects are related to one another. 
Apriori algorithm is also called frequent pattern mining. Generally, you operate the Apriori algorithm on a database that consists of a huge number of transactions. 
Let's understand the apriori algorithm with the help of an example; suppose you go to Big Bazar and buy different products. 
It helps the customers buy their products with ease and increases the sales performance of the Big Bazar.<br></br>


**Important- Note: Explore the dataset once before going through the code.**
